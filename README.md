# Electrostatic Field Simulation

This project simulates the electrostatic field generated by charged particles using CUDA and SDL2 for visualization.

## Prerequisites

- CUDA Toolkit
- SDL2 library

## Building the Project

To build the project, run the following command:

```sh
make build
```
This will compile the electrostatic_field.cu file and generate the executable in the bin directory.

## Running the Simulation
To run the simulation, use the following command:

```sh
make run 
```

You can also specify the number of particles using the `-n` option:
```sh
bin/electrostatic_field -n <number_of_particles>
```
